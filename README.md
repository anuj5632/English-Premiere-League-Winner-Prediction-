# English-Premiere-League-Winner-Prediction-

Objective:- Objective is to predict the final points table of the english premiere league using historic data of about 22 years using machinne learning algorithms like Random Forest regressor and xgboost.
Got the dataset from kaggle and added some features such as Goal Difference(GD) and latest Fifa ratings according to their recent form and their win rate.

Issues faced: 1]To select the features that plays crucial role in the prediction and adding new features.
              2] To make the webapp look more realistic,have to add some 3D elements and football players avatars.
              3] Handling the json files to create live background to be unique and stylized way.
              4] Managing different html,css,json files to integrate it with flask.

Conclusion: The English Premier League Winner Prediction project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning in forecasting sports outcomes. By leveraging over two decades of historical data and enhancing it with additional features like Goal Difference, Win Rate, and up-to-date FIFA ratings, the model provides realistic predictions of the final league table. Integration of algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost ensured robust performance and accuracy. Furthermore, the deployment of a visually appealing web application with interactive elements and player avatars adds to the user experience. Despite challenges in feature selection, data formatting, and frontend-backend integration, the project culminated in a functional and engaging tool that could be expanded further for real-time updates and broader sports analytics applications.
